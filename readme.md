# JS For Five
This Chrome extension turns on JavaScript for 5 minutes. 

It's safer to surf with JavaScript turned off. However some sites force you to turn it on. It's easy to forget you re-enabled it, which leaves you susceptible to malicious sites. This extension will turn JS back off after 5 minutes, keeping you safe.

For anyone who has ever accidentally navigated to WWWfacebokDOTcom, this is for you. For anyone who has ever had their browser locked up by malicious JS, this is for you.
